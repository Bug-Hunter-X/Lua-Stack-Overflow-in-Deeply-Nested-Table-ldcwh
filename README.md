This repository contains a Lua program that demonstrates a common error: stack overflow due to unbounded recursion when traversing deeply nested tables.  The `bug.lua` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.lua` provides a corrected version that avoids the stack overflow.  The error arises from the recursive nature of the table traversal without a proper base case to terminate the recursion in deeply nested scenarios. The solution incorporates a mechanism to prevent revisiting already processed tables, effectively resolving the unbounded recursion and the resulting stack overflow.
